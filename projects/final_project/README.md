# Capstone Projects

## Overview

During your final weeks, you will be building two projects. One will be a Portfolio site and the other will be your most ambitious and exciting project for this course!

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance. These will be the sites that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

## Attendance

There are no full day classes during project weeks, but we do expect you to be working on your project daily and be available during the usual class times (9AM - 5PM Eastern) for any meetings and check-ins with instructors as needed.

There are **daily attendance checks on weekdays at 9:00AM EST and 2:00PM EST**. A thread will be posted in the classroom channel at those times and you must respond to it within 2 hours or you will be marked absent. _Again, failure to make an attendance check will result in an absence_.

- **Sep 19th - Oct 3rd**: This is your Thanksgiving holiday! There will be no attendance checks during this period.
- **Wedbesdays - There will be outcomes as usual at 3:30 PM EST
- **Monday Oct 3rd**: Project presentation day! You're required to be in the class Zoom starting at 9:00 AM EST.

## Requirements

### 1. Portfolio Site

Create a site that shows off your work.

[More Information](portfolio.md)

### 2. Capstone Project

Your capstone project should be an app that

- has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin.
- is hosted somewhere on the internet (Heroku, Netlify, etc.).

Alternatively you may go on myGA and take the DevOps learning module and use the project prompt from that module to make your capstone project!

## Technical Requirements (Final Project)

### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:

#### MVP - minimum viable product

- **2 git repositories hosted on Github** (one for your frontend and one for your backend), with a link to your hosted projects, and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often!
- At **least** one Github commit per day (see below for more details)
    - <details><summary>How to commit every day even if you spending time learning a new tech stack</summary>

    Keep a time stamped log of what you worked on every day (short bullet points are fine)

    You can do this through:

    - regular GitHub - make a `schedule.md` file and add to it every day
    - [GitHub gists - a fast and easy way to share markdowns](https://gist.github.com/) - this will show revision history with time stamps
    - Google Docs - you can see a version history and name your versions

    - Use GitHub's Projects tab

    Another means that time stamps your daily efforts

    </details>

- **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
- Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in each of your GitHub repos.
- Due to the open-ended nature of this capstone project, each project will have their own additional MVPs that are agreed upon by you and the instructional team.
- Demonstrate that you can **teach yourself something new**, use a technology that you haven't used in class _NOR_ in a previous project. To avoid getting too deep into something that's beyond your current capabilities, here's how to choose what to learn:

    - Think about your general level of comfort throughout this class:

        - 1 - What have I done with my life?
        - 2 - I am lost, help!
        - 3 - Hanging in there...
        - 4 - Perfect, let's keep going
        - 5 - Go faster, I'm bored

  - Here is a list of technology stacks that you can use to start your project, listed according to what will work with your general level of comfort throughout this class:
    - 1-3
        - Redo a previous stack, but add a CSS framework like:
            - https://get.foundation/
            - https://tailwindcss.com/
            - https://bulma.io/
    - 4 (Please check job listings in your area to see if these technologies are being requested for Jr. Web Developers):
        - Try your hand at a new piece of technology that uses the languages we learned
        - PERN Stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node)
            - https://github.com/mahuntington/PERN-Stack
        - Advanced React Tools (webpack, redux, router):
            - https://github.com/mahuntington/react-notes
        - Angular.js (aka old Angular, Angular 1.X):
            - https://github.com/mahuntington/angularjsnotes
    - 5 (Please check job listings in your area to see if these technologies are being requested for Jr. Web Developers):
        - Try a new backend language and framework:
            - PHP Laravel with React:
                    - https://github.com/mahuntington/php-notes
                    - https://github.com/mahuntington/Laravel-React

                - C# and .Net
                    - https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIRPolyglot/tree/main/cs
            - Try a new front-end framework:
                - Vue
                    - https://vuejs.org/
                    - https://github.com/jlboba/vue_contacts_frontend
                - Angular (aka new Angular, 2.X+)
                    - https://angular.io/
            - Anything here:

                - https://teamtreehouse.com/


ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

- Is ~5-10 minutes in length
- Use 1-3 minutes to show off your portfolio then switch over and talk about your app
- Shows off the features of the app
- Be sure to talk about the new thing you taught yourself
- Explains the technical details
- Explains the technical challenges
- Explains which improvements you might make

## How to Submit your Project

Your project is due on **Monday Oct 3rd, at 9:00 am ET.** You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

Per usual, fill out your project information via the [google presentation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDu6gZjNYr8xHoQTsAr8eC50XHOrtHrqfeyODFRSF1s/edit#gid=890219392). Remember this is the order in which you'll be presenting!

## Meetings with instructors

_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your capstone project._

**What you should work on before meeting with an instructor:**

- Create new GitHub repos outside of your class repository (also, don't forget to make a `.gitignore` file, as needed)
- Create your user stories and add them to your README.md
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links)

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).
* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.
* Create your **user stories**.
* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards.
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems.
* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online.
1. Seek out help with your classmates. Make sure you post in the sos channel so the instructors can keep track of who is asking for help!
1. Seek out help with our class TA.
1. After all other avenues have been exhausted, seek help from your assigned instructor. Please refer to [How to Ask a Question](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-SmellyCat/wiki/How-To-Ask-A-Question) before you reach out.

**TA Hours** (all normal times EST)
