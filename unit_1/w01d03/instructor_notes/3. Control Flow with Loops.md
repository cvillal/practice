https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/1611/files/f797ec7f-0d68-4ae8-a633-1f19714c0c38

## Setup
1. Navigate to your `student_examples` folder for today.
2. Create a file called `loops_and_conditionals.js` for practicing your work.
3. Open this file in your text editor. Add a console.log in your file run the code in your terminal `node loops_and_conditionals.js`.

## Lesson Objectives
_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

- Use conditionals and booleans and loops

## Loops

https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/1611/files/9f23d462-08ea-45d0-99a5-bbd74565e4e6

Loops allow us to do something repeatedly. We'll use for loops to build out some more control flow examples

```js
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step' , step);
}
```

## The Problem

https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/1611/files/939cba6d-ed90-4191-8799-b684e7dcc663

Find the sum of all the even integers between 0 and 10

## Pseudo Code
Let's start out by pseudo-coding:

We should write down what we think we need to do or what the questions is asking us to do in **human language** - not computer language.

## Activity
Take ~ 3-5 minutes to write some pseudocode of how we can get the sum
- Post your pseudocode in slack

## Let's Work Through it Together
Note: You may have worked through this in different steps. That's ok! There are many different approaches. The key is to break it down into small steps and test each one.

## Start Small

https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/1611/files/6a48b602-3b22-4664-a87d-23976a5e2abd

First we have to 'get' the numbers 1 - 10.
We could console.log each one separately:

```javascript
console.log(1)
console.log(2)
//etc.
```

What's another way?

## Loop!
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i ++ ){
  console.log(i);
}
```

Now we have a way to 'get' the numbers 1 - 10

## Control Flow

https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/1611/files/112fc707-9ff3-432d-a889-9e2c0bb9c3aa

We have to figure out how to determine if one of the numbers is even. This is where *Control Flow* comes in:

We can choose to do something depending on the case.

_For this problem:_
- If it's even, let's do something with it...
- If it's odd, let's ignore it.

With control flow, you can decide what to do in different instances.

## The Power of If Statements in Control Flow
This is where **if statements** come into play! We can tell our program to do something *if* it meets certain criteria.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i ++ ){
  if (i == 1) {
    console.log("the number is 1")
  }
}
```

Note: You don't always _need_ an else statement. If your _else_ statement would just be a comment like:

```js
if (true){
  console.log('awesome');
} else {
  // do nothing
}

```

Then you can omit the else statement.

We don't just need the number 1, we need all the even numbers. How can we check if a number is even?

```javascript

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i ++ ){
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    console.log("the number is even", i)
  }
}
```

Now we need a variable to hold our sum

```javascript
let evenSum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0 ) {
    evenSum += i;
  }
}
```
